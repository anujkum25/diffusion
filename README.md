# diffusion
experiments on diffusion models and GenAI on images. here , we summarize the latest work going on in diffusion space.


1. dataset:
    - MS COCO
    - Pick-a-Pic
    - Asthetic

2. Base diffusion models:
     - unconditional
     - text to image
     - large text to image
     - two steps
     - control and adaption

3. Issues with basic diffusion models:
     - numeric issues
     - negation
     - spatial and temporal issues

4. LLM based diffusion:
    - to handle numeric and spatial issues
    -  better prompting and applying LLMs on prompt before image generation
  
5. RL over diffusion models:
     - DDPO
     - DRLX
  
6. Using diffusion for RL : (slighly off topic for us)


7. Theory of diffusion

8. Components of diffusion

9. Active unsolved problems

10. Third party libraries and web UI for exploration

11. Misc

12. Git repos where contributions can be made

13. Issues interesting to me and apporach for the same
